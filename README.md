// Description:
WeBank offers various services that aim to fully immerse users in the blockchain. As a cryptocurrency wallet and an NFT marketplace, this website is a platform for hobbyists and collectors alike. 

My original contention with the crypto market is that the industry is somewhat restrictive due to the enormous amount of time, knowledge, and resources needed to become involved with crypto or NFTs. Therefore, WeBank's simplistic user interface and design elements are comforting to first-time users. Additionally, the “About” section can be accessed through the website's navigation bar informing users about the website, and blockchain-related technologies. 

The main function of the platform offer users the ability to connect with other like-minded individuals and NFT collectors in the world's first interactive, digital museum that celebrates elements of art and design. Users can create personalized profiles to participate in commerce on the platform's marketplace. Currently, NFTs are stigmatized due to their value as an economic proposition. My website aims to shift the narrative surrounding digital tokens from trading pieces to highly celebrated artworks that combine both captivating design and technology. 

A secondary function of the website is the cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to make transactions using digital currency. These transactions exist on the blockchain which contributes to users efficacy and transparency. Once users have created an account, they are prompted to connect the site to their Metamask accounts, which is a third-party entity to initiate transactions and crypto purchases. 

WeBanks project directory is separated into static, template, and other folders. The site is written in CSS, Python, HTML, and Java. Throughout CS50 I became increasingly comfortable coding in these languages but had immense difficulty when working with SQL Lite, SQL Alchemy, Flask, and other extensions. 

When considering both the front and back ends of the project, I am most proud of the subtle design elements and animations that I believe contribute to its functional, yet appealing user experience.
